## 2024-05-22 - Client-Side Hashing & Legacy Migration
**Vulnerability:** User passwords were stored in plaintext in `localStorage`.
**Learning:** Client-side apps without a backend often default to insecure storage. Migrating data on the client requires careful handling of "legacy" states (plaintext) vs "secure" states (hashed) during the first login after the fix.
**Prevention:** Always use `Web Crypto API` (PBKDF2/SHA-256) for any sensitive data, even in demos. Never store plaintext credentials.

## 2024-05-22 - Plaintext Password Storage
**Vulnerability:** User passwords were stored in plaintext in `localStorage` under `frenchApp_credentials`.
**Learning:** Even in client-side-only "simulation" apps, developers often default to plaintext storage for simplicity, underestimating the risk of XSS accessing these credentials.
**Prevention:** Always use client-side hashing (like PBKDF2 via Web Crypto API) before storing any credentials locally, even if there is no backend. This ensures that a compromised local storage (via XSS) does not yield usable passwords.
