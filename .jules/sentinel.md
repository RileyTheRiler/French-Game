## 2024-05-22 - Plaintext Password Storage
**Vulnerability:** User passwords were stored in plaintext in `localStorage` under `frenchApp_credentials`.
**Learning:** Even in client-side-only "simulation" apps, developers often default to plaintext storage for simplicity, underestimating the risk of XSS accessing these credentials.
**Prevention:** Always use client-side hashing (like PBKDF2 via Web Crypto API) before storing any credentials locally, even if there is no backend. This ensures that a compromised local storage (via XSS) does not yield usable passwords.
