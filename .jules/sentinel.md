## 2024-05-22 - Client-Side Hashing & Legacy Migration
**Vulnerability:** User passwords were stored in plaintext in `localStorage`.
**Learning:** Client-side apps without a backend often default to insecure storage. Migrating data on the client requires careful handling of "legacy" states (plaintext) vs "secure" states (hashed) during the first login after the fix.
**Prevention:** Always use `Web Crypto API` (PBKDF2/SHA-256) for any sensitive data, even in demos. Never store plaintext credentials.
