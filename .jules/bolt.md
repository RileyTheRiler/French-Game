## 2024-05-22 - Context Memoization & Merge Conflicts
**Learning:** Found critical contexts (`VocabularyContext`, `ProgressContext`) with massive merge conflicts and missing memoization. The `ToastContext` also lacks memoization for its value, causing unnecessary re-renders in all consumers whenever a toast is triggered.
**Action:** When fixing merge conflicts in Context Providers, always enforce `useMemo` on the `value` prop to prevent performance regressions. Broken builds hide performance metrics.
